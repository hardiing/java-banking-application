# Java Banking Application

The final project for my Java Programming II course. It uses Swing to create a GUI banking application. Using text storage, the application allows the user to add customers. Customers can have a savings account tied to their name, and the balance is set by depositing/withdrawing money.

The user can step through the users in the text storage, in addition to searching by name for customers, then stepping through the results returned. Each customer is only allowed to have one savings account. Each account also has an interest rate assigned to it, and the application gives the user the chance to enter in the current month to find out how much interest the account has earned so far in the year.
